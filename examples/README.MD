# Vaadin Model View Update - Examples

For an introduction the MVU pattern for Vaadin, see my [vaadin-mvu](https://github.com/dvekeman/vaadin-mvu) library.

All examples are standalone gradle projects. To run them, just go into the example folder and type

```
./gradlew :appRun
```

## Example1: Simple Counter

This is a basic example showing some components which interact together to increment a single counter.

## Example2: REST DataBinding

This example shows that combining the MVU pattern with other approaches (in this case direct databinding) is
perfectly fine.

## Example3: Calculator (port of the Vaadin MVP Example)

This example shows how the Vaadin MVP Calculator example would look like in MVU.

## Example4: Combo

This example shows how to combine several components together.
