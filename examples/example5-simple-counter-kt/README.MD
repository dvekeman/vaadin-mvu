# Example 5: Counter - Kotlin Example

Here is a screenshot to set the scene

![Vaadin MVU Ticker Example](https://github.com/dvekeman/vaadin-mvu/blob/master/examples/example5-simple-counter/doc/img/vaadin-mvu-example5.png)

To get it up and running quickly

```
./gradlew appRun
```

This will do a gradle build and start a Jetty server with the Vaadin application running.

```
21:56:51 INFO  Jetty 9.2.24.v20180105 started and listening on port 8080
21:56:51 INFO  vaadin-mvu-example runs at:
21:56:51 INFO    http://localhost:8080/vaadin-mvu-example
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/example5-simple-counter-kt`

This demonstrates how to write your Vaadin MVU in Kotlin!

## Notes

This example uses version 0.3.0 which includes support for Kotlin
